# UPASTHITI-HackCBS3.0

UPASTHITI means being present/available. Due to the pandemic, most of the things in life went virtual. Our classes were happening virtually. We noticed there was no means for a teacher to check the attention of students towards classes. Most of them were attending but with closed eyes and no voice at all. UPASTHITI is all around this problem.
